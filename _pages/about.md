# 🎊 Welcome to my profile!

Hi! I am a creative technologist at heart and enjoy approaching problems from multiple perspectives. I am an inter-disciplinant and explored many ideas and projects, starting first from music to audio, spanning sound, acoustics, architecture, and speech (particularly infant speech). I graduated with my PhD. in 2025 from the [National University of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2023/04/TAN-Johann-Kay-Ann.pdf) for my contributions in ANC research applied to complex spaces. My dissertation is titled; *"Developments and applications of active noise control in plenum windows."* Concurrently, I also contributed as a researcher at the [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) for toddler speech and audio processing. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or AMA at; <a href='mailto:johann@live.com.sg'>johann@live.com.sg

My research interest is focused on the area of audio and acoustics, and my PhD was in the sub-topic of active noise control (eg. aircraft cabin) and soundscape research. I also contributed to several papers investigating virtual reality reproduction for soundscapes with HMD systems (Oculus Quest). On the industrious front, I worked on several acoustics construction project and audio projects relating to speech enhancement work (incl. AEC/AFC, dereverbeation, and speech source separation).  

I have published several papers in Q1 journals and conferences on these topic and interested readers can find my Researcher profile here; <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2efZMcAAAAJ'>Google Scholar.

In my spare time I also enjoy music, so some of the projects displayed here includes my musical works which I pursued on the side (original singles, podcast, etc...), as well as some professional work for institutions and government. 🐦

[A time-domain study on the effects of noise source incidence on plenum window with active noise control](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.111946)

**TAN J.K.**, & LAU, S-K.

- A time-domain simulation method is developed to study noise control in plenum window.
- 3D time-domain validation is conducted with an experimental study for comparability.
- The method also motivates further time-domain analysis on multiple and moving noise sources.

**TAN J.K.**, & LAU, S-K.

- The time-domain simulation method is extended to investigate the performance degradation due to multiple and moving noise sources on ANC systems installed on plenum windows.
- Convergence time increased when exposed to incrementing noise sources of some noise types.
- Active noise control performance is altered when exposed to certain types of moving sources.

[Experimental study of active noise control for a full-scale plenum window in a domestic apartment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2024.110120)

**TAN J.K.**, & LAU, S-K.

- Implementation of active noise control (ANC) is field-tested and deployed in a full-scale plenum window.
- A comparison is made for single, and decentralized dual-channel ANC configuration. A Dual-channel ANC can achieve 6 dB local attenuation below 500 Hz or 5.4 dB below 800 Hz.
- The ANC applied in the plenum window proved effective against common urban noise types.
- The developed ANC system remains robust even with mechanical ventilation fan operating inside the plenum.

**TAN J.K.**, HASEGAWA, Y., & LAU, S-K.

- 61 commonly occurring sounds in the urban city were identified and a comprehensive sound categorization scheme and alternate schemes are proposed.
- Leaves rustling was found to be highly pleasant and calming in soundscape context and human vocalization had comparably higher eventfulness attribute than human activities.
- Specific traffic source elements contributed the most to traffic noise annoyance.

- Developed a regression model of overall sound quality for urban soundscapes.
- Landscape features and traffic types have a main effect on overall sound quality of soundscape.

**TAN J.K.**, HASEGAWA, Y., & LAU, S-K.

- Specific aural sound sources are found to correlate uniquely to appropriateness while controlling for relevant visual elements
- Perception of appropriateness is found to likely be more dependent on the individual visual element
- Appropriateness in soundscape is derived from the expectation of sound sources in a specific environment, place or function and heard by a listener.
