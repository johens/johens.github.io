# 🎊 Welcome to my profile!

Hi! I am a creative technologist at heart and enjoy approaching problems from multiple perspectives. I am cross-disciplinary and have explored many different ideas and projects, starting first from music to audio, sound, acoustics, architecture and speech (particularly infant speech)). I graduated with my PhD. from the [National University of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2023/04/TAN-Johann-Kay-Ann.pdf) for my contributions in ANC research, titled; *"Developments and applications of active noise control in plenum windows."* Recently, I contributed as a researcher at the [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) for toddler speech and audio processing. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or AMA at; <a href='mailto:johann@live.com.sg'>johann@live.com.sg

My research interest includes audio and acoustics, and my main research is in the area of active noise cancellation for complex environments (eg. aircraft cabin) and soundscape research. I have published several papers in Q1 journals and conferences on these topic; <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2efZMcAAAAJ'>Google Scholar.

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G2efZMcAAAAJ&citation_for_view=G2efZMcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='2efZMcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC'></span></strong>
- A time-domain simulation method is developed to study noise control in plenum window.
- 3D time-domain validation is conducted with an experimental study for comparability.
- The method also motivates further time-domain analysis on multiple and moving noise sources.
